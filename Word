//Translate the following pseudocode for randomly permuting the characters in
//a string into a method in the given Java class.

//Read a word.
//Repeat word.length() times
//   Pick a random position i in the word, but not the last position.
//   Pick a random position j > i in the word. (this is tricky)
//   Swap the letters at positions j and i.
//Print the word.

//To swap the letters, construct substrings as follows:
//  http://i.imgur.com/re4bGPu.png

//Create and return the string:
//   first + word.substring(j, j + 1) + middle
//         + word.substring(i, i + 1) + last

// Need help starting this question? In the lesson titled 
// "Starting points: Problem Set Questions", go to the
// problem titled "Problem Set 5 - Question 2" for some tips on 
// how to begin.

//I recommend that you implement and test the swapping before implementing
//the loop. If something is wrong in the swap, it will be much more difficult
//to find it you have executed the swap many times. That is an example of
//step-wise refinement. Code a little, test, code a little more.
